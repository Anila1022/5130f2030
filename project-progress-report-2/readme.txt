We completed the signup and login pages this week, along with validation.
and updated our calculator with a few financial computations.
The page has a MySQL database connection. Additionally, the backend is where the data is kept.
I've included screen grabs, used the password verify feature, and stored the hashed password in the database.


My page and database are housed on an AWS server.
