We completed the signup and login pages this week, along with validation and updated our calculator with a few financial computations. As this the secong week of project, I think we didn't go deep into the implementation. So, I can tell that I'm proud of the login and signup page that we've developed and the knowledge we gathered in the process.
The page has a MySQL database connection. Additionally, the backend is where the data is kept.
I've included screen grabs, used the password verify feature, and stored the hashed password in the database.

My page and database are housed on an AWS server.

Thanks and for any questions, contact -
