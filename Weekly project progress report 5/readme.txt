This week, we improved our calculator and added two new categories. Additionally, a web interface has been created to display the data that is kept in the database.
Added a dealership section with links to the relevant pages so users might be redirected there. comprising two distinct subsections.
Additionally, users can now provide feedback.
Mostly the database.html page, where we can interact with this page to see and save data.
and enhanced our calculator with a few financial computations. additionally included two additional banks with interest rates.
The page has a MySQL database connection. Additionally, the data is kept in the back end.I've included screenshots, used the password verify feature, and stored the hashed password in the database.

And below are the my server link to access the page .
