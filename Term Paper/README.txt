Title: Streamlining Web Feature Deprecation for Enhanced User Security


After giving it a thought, I decided to write a paper - As web applications evolve, new features are frequently introduced, which may later require deprecation due to security concerns. However, the current process of deprecation lacks coordination among different browser vendors, leading to compatibility issues and prolonged security threats. This paper suggests a progressive security mechanism to streamline feature deprecation and enhance security guarantees for users.
