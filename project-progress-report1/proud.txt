This week, I've started making a website along with my teammates and developed the home page of our website. Although it is not completely done, I'm proud of the work we've done by creating a html page, a stylesheet to support the html page, an animation file i.e., a js filerequired for the animation. We've created the page with the following tabs: 
-> Home
-> Leasing
-> Buying
-> Comparision
-> Contact
